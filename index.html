                            <b>Role</b> - This project is currently working and existing when I joined TALISMA Corp. at
                            that time
                            EBG Corp.
                            has been boug- ht the Razargator corp., Earlier razorgator was using CyberSource payment
                            gateway for
                            transaction, and EBG using Chase Payment gateway, so I replaced the CyberSource payment
                            gateway by Chase
                            payment gateway. And the-n later I integrated Google captcha and so many things. I learned
